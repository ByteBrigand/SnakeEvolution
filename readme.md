# Snake Evolution Game

Snake Evolution Game is a simple evolutionary simulation of snakes that learn to find and eat food using neural networks. The game is implemented in C and uses the SDL2 library for graphics and user input. Snakes have their neural networks evolved over time to improve their ability to find and consume food.

## Features

- Multiple snakes with their own neural networks.
- Evolution of neural networks over time.
- Adjustable mutation rate and mutation magnitude.
- Save and load neural networks from a file.
- Visual representation of the game using graphics.

## Dependencies

- SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer 2)
- SDL2_ttf (SDL TrueType Font library)


## Controls

- Use the arrow keys to adjust the mutation rate and mutation magnitude.
- Press "s" to save the neural networks to a file.
- Press "l" to load neural networks from a file.
- Press "e" to manually evolve the snakes.
- Press "q" to quit the game.
- Press "f" to pause rendering.
- Press "r" to resume rendering.
